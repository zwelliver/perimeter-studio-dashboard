# Studio Command Center — Frontend Environment Variables
# ============================================================
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development.
# On Railway, set these in the Railway service environment tab.
#
# IMPORTANT: Only variables prefixed with VITE_ are bundled
# into the client. Never put secrets in VITE_ variables.
# ============================================================

# Backend API URL used by the Vite dev server proxy.
# In production (Railway), the FastAPI backend serves the
# frontend itself, so /api/* calls go to the same origin —
# this variable is only needed when running the dev server
# against a remote backend.
#
# Default (when unset): http://localhost:5001
# Example for Railway dev:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
